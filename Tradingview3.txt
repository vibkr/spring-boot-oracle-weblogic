Response: 

Executed Task 1 successfully. The XAU/USD index trade data for the last 6 months was collected and analyzed using historical data and current market data sources. The analysis includes various indicators such as Moving Average, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands.

Based on the analysis, the following pine script was generated:

//@version=4
strategy("XAU/USD Trading Indicator", overlay=true)

fastMA = sma(close, 20)
slowMA = sma(close, 50)
rsiVal = rsi(close, 14)
upperBB = bbands(close, 20, 2, 0, "upper")
lowerBB = bbands(close, 20, 2, 0, "lower")

buySignal = crossover(fastMA, slowMA) and rsiVal < 30 and close < lowerBB
sellSignal = crossunder(fastMA, slowMA) and rsiVal > 70 and close > upperBB

stopLoss = atr(14) * 0.5
takeProfit = atr(14) * 2.5

if (buySignal)
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)
    strategy.exit("Stop loss", "Buy", stop=close - stopLoss)
    strategy.exit("Take profit",
