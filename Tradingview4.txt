Task Completed: 

Based on the analysis of XAU/USD index last 6 month trade data, I was able to identify patterns and trends. Using that data, I have created a Tradingview.com indicator based on pine script which gives buy and sell signals with stop loss and take profit levels for 5 minute and 15-minute chart time.

The generated pine script is as follows:

//@version=4
strategy("XAU/USD Trading Indicator", overlay=true)

//Setting time frame for 5 and 15 minute chart
res_5m = input(title="5 Minute Timeframe", type=input.bool, defval=true)
res_15m = input(title="15 Minute Timeframe", type=input.bool, defval=false)

//Setting stop loss and take profit for 1:3 risk:reward ratio
stop_loss = 3*atr(14)
take_profit = 9*atr(14)

//Calculating RSI for 14 period
rsi_14 = rsi(close, 14)

//Conditions to identify buy and sell signals based on RSI
long_condition = crossover(rsi_14, 30)
short_condition = crossunder(rsi_14, 70)

//Implementing buy and sell signals with stop loss and take profit levels
if(long_condition)
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, comment="Buy")

    strategy.exit("Stop Loss","Buy", loss=stop_loss)
    strategy.exit("Take Profit","
