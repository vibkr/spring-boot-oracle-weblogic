Task 2 response:

Dear user, based on the analysis of the US30 index last 6 month 5 minute trade data, I have created a prototype Tradingview.com indicator using Pine Script. The indicator generates buy and sell signals with stop loss and take profit levels for 5 minute and 15 minute chart time.

The Pine script code is as follows:

//@version=4
strategy("US30 5M/15M Trading Indicator", overlay=true)

// Create the RSI indicator
rsiLength = input(14)
rsi = rsi(close, rsiLength)

// Create moving averages
fastMA = ema(close, 5)
slowMA = ema(close, 10)

// Define the stop loss and take profit levels
stopLoss = atr(14) * 1.5
takeProfit = atr(14) * 5

// Determine buy and sell signals based on RSI and moving averages
buySignal = crossover(fastMA, slowMA) and rsi < 30
sellSignal = crossunder(fastMA, slowMA) and rsi > 70

// Place stop loss and take profit levels
strategy.exit("Stop Loss/Profit", "Long", stop=close - stopLoss, limit=close + takeProfit)
strategy.exit("Stop Loss/Profit", "Short", stop=close + stopLoss, limit=close - takeProfit)

// Execute trades based on buy and sell signals
